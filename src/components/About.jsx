      <p>
        Hello! I'm a passionate developer with a love for creating beautiful and
        functional web experiences. My journey began with a curiosity about how
        websites work, and it quickly grew into a full-time career. I'm always
        eager to learn and experiment with new technologies to build engaging,
        user-friendly interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy exploring new frameworks, contributing to
        open-source projects, and finding innovative ways to solve problems.
